# Random-Quote-Generator

FSJS Project 1

Project Overview

For this first project, I created an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. I had to build an array of quote objects to store the quotes and then create functions to display random quotes from the array and then print them to the screen.  For added visual I created a function to change the background color of the quote box and also gave them a timer to auto change every five seconds.
